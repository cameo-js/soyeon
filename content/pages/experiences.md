The year I spent in Mexico, located across the Pacific, ingrained in me the value of diversity and multiculturalism. This image shows my former colleagues from the purchasing team and me.

Whenever the Mexican holiday came, the company always celebrated it with Mexicoâ€™s traditional foods, costumes, ornaments, and traditional performances. I really loved enjoying all of that. The picture is of ellote, one of the most popular snacks in Mexico.

Even though there were many cultural differences, we still shared similar emotions, sentiments and thoughts. The meaning of multiculturalism and diversity to me is openness to difference as well as some level of universality. This openness gave me lifelong friendships. This is a picture of my friend Josefina.

My favorite artist is Frida Kahlo. Finally I had the opportunity to visit her house where she lived in Mexico City.

When I came back to Korea from Mexico, I worked for P&G Korea, the multinational company, for 3 years.

The biggest lesson I learned at P&G was how to effectively contribute in a team-based environment and communicate with people from different backgrounds.

This picture was taken at the sales event of the cosmetic brand that I owned. As a sales planning manager, I was solely responsible for the $70M business in the South Korean market. This experience honed my critical thinking and problem solving skills. Also, my leadership skills were improved by effectively managing tasks and collaborating with team members and related departments.

My first overseas experience was in Spain, where I studied as a exchange student when I was 20 years old. From this experience, I became more interested in learning different cultures and languages.

I walked the Camino de Santiago, which was 400km in 2 weeks. This displayed my strong endurance and mentality. Most of all, I love a good challenge.

I traveled Latin America for about 3 months. I love traveling, walking in nature, experiencing other cultures and traditions, and speaking with people in different languages.
