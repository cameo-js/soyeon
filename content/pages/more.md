Here, my work for my graduation exhibition at university is pictured. I had been working on questioning the inequality of powers in our society with my creative jobs. In this work, I expressed in figures the poverty and loneliness of young adults trying to survive, stuck in tiny one-room apartments in a metropolitan city. I will continue to focus my attention towards people with less power and look for possible solutions throughout my research.

Iâ€™ve been a member of Toastmasters International since 2017. By delivering speeches in English and conducting formal meetings, this is where participants can develop communication and leadership skills.
