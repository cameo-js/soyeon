My name is Soyeon Kim and I’m a counseling psychology doctoral program applicant for Fall 2021. As a doctoral candidate, I would like to pursue research projects surrounding (about) working adults and their mental health and wellbeing.</p>\n<p>My specific research questions investigate the ways in which dispositional factors impact mental illness and contribute to performance, while also exploring how work experiences can shape an individual’s perception of their life satisfaction and the meaning of life itself. I’m also fascinated with learning more about how women juggle their work-life demands and strike a balance between the two, as well how societal pressures and external expectations can affect their decisions. Further, I’m interested in human marginalization that is driven by societal changes (e.g., advanced technology, post COVID-19). My specific point of interest includes what specific mental illnesses are rising due to external circumstances, how environmental factors (e.g., job loss, job change, non-face to face communication) affect people’s psychological problems, and the interpersonal and intrapersonal resources people can refer to when struggling with these sorts of mental health challenges.</p>\n<p>My professional experiences (working for several global enterprises) motivated my research question and also provided me with multicultural experiences. I worked for Samsung Electronics located in Mexico, Queretaro for 1 year, where the majority of employees (more than 500) were Mexican. Not only did I earn life-lasting friendships, but also I had the privilege to become more familiar with the vibrant and unique Mexican culture. This is not to say that I didn’t initially feel some cultural barriers - especially within the office place. Most importantly, I learned to respect other people and to appreciate beautiful outcomes when different cultures meet. When I got back to Korea, I worked for P&#x26;G Korea, where I worked with people from many different countries. Again, in this mixing pot, I experienced that the greatest value that we can pursue is diversity, and we should prioritize respecting each other without any bias.</p>\n<p>I have a strong commitment to vocational psychology. My greatest wish and desire is to continue my lifelong dedication to empowering people to live their own lives, true to themselves, through my research in vocational psychology. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Introduction","date":null,"description":null,"socialImage":"/media/about.png"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/introduction/"}}}
