This image shows my former colleagues from the purchasing team and me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/1_Samsung_Mexico.jpg\" alt=\"samsung maxico\"></p>\n<p>Whenever the Mexican holiday came, the company always celebrated it with Mexicoâ€™s traditional foods, costumes, ornaments, and traditional performances. I really loved enjoying all of that. The picture is of ellote, one of the most popular snacks in Mexico.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/2_Samsung_Mexico.jpg\" alt=\"samsung maxico\"></p>\n<p>Even though there were many cultural differences, we still shared similar emotions, sentiments and thoughts. The meaning of multiculturalism and diversity to me is openness to difference as well as some level of universality. This openness gave me lifelong friendships.

Finally I had the opportunity to visit her house where she lived in Mexico City. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/5_Samsung_Mexico.jpg\" alt=\"samsung maxico\"></p>\n<p>When I came back to Korea from Mexico, I worked for P&#x26;G Korea, the multinational company, for 3 years.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/6_P&#x26;G.jpg\" alt=\"P&#x26;G\"></p>\n<p>The biggest lesson I learned at P&#x26;G was how to effectively contribute in a team-based environment and communicate with people from different backgrounds.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/7_P&#x26;G.jpg\" alt=\"P&#x26;G\"></p>\n<p>With colleagues in P&#x26;G.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/8_P&#x26;G.jpg\" alt=\"P&#x26;G\"></p>\n<p>This picture was taken at the sales event of the cosmetic brand that I owned. As a sales planning manager, I was solely responsible for the $70M business in the South Korean market. This experience honed my critical thinking and problem solving skills. Also, my leadership skills were improved by effectively managing tasks and collaborating with team members and related departments. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/9_P&#x26;G.jpg\" alt=\"P&#x26;G\"></p>\n<p>My first overseas experience was in Spain, where I studied as a exchange student when I was 20 years old. From this experience, I became more interested in learning different cultures and languages.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/10_Spain.jpg\" alt=\"Spain\"></p>\n<p>I walked the Camino de Santiago, which was 400km in 2 weeks. This displayed my strong endurance and mentality. Most of all, I love a good challenge.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/11_Spain.jpg\" alt=\"Spain\"></p>\n<p>I traveled Latin America for about 3 months. I love traveling, walking in nature, experiencing other cultures and traditions, and speaking with people in different languages.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/12_Latin_A.jpg\" alt=\"Latin A\">\n<img src=\"/media/13_Latin_A.jpg\" alt=\"Latin A\">\n<img src=\"/media/14_Latin_A.jpg\" alt=\"Latin A\">\n<img src=\"/media/15_Latin_A.jpg\" alt=\"Latin A\">\n<img src=\"/media/16_Latin_A.jpg\" alt=\"Latin A\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Professional & overseas experiences","date":null,"description":null,"socialImage":"/media/about.png"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/experiences/"}}}
